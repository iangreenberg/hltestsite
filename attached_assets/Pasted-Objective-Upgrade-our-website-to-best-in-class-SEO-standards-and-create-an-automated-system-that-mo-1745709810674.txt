Scope of Work:
	1.	On-Page SEO Overhaul
	â€¢	Ensure fully optimized title tags, meta descriptions, H1/H2/H3 structures.
	â€¢	Correct all image alt text, file names, and compression for site speed.
	â€¢	Optimize internal linking and external authority links.
	â€¢	Install structured schema markup (for articles, products, FAQ, breadcrumbs, etc.).
	â€¢	Full mobile optimization, passing Google Lighthouse tests.
	â€¢	Full core web vitals compliance (LCP, FID, CLS).
	2.	Technical SEO Enhancement
	â€¢	Create and submit updated XML sitemap dynamically.
	â€¢	Set up robots.txt to guide crawlers correctly.
	â€¢	Implement canonical tags to prevent duplicate content issues.
	â€¢	Add Open Graph metadata and Twitter Cards for social sharing optimization.
	â€¢	Ensure SSL (HTTPS), HTTP/2, and fast loading times.
	â€¢	Implement breadcrumb structured data.
	3.	SEO Monitoring & Improvement Tool (Daily Engine)
	â€¢	Build a backend tool (simple dashboard or admin panel) that:
a. Runs daily site audits (errors, warnings, opportunities).
b. Tracks keyword rankings for at least 25 keywords.
c. Analyzes competitors once a week (optional stretch goal).
d. Lists prioritized daily action items based on audit data.
e. Suggests new content ideas based on keyword gaps.
	4.	Automation
	â€¢	Integrate with Google Search Console and Google Analytics 4 for real-time SEO performance tracking.
	â€¢	Set up alerts if rankings drop or major errors are detected.
	â€¢	Optionally use APIs (like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or SERP API) for keyword ranking tracking.
	5.	Reporting
	â€¢	Build a simple weekly SEO performance report emailed automatically (rank changes, traffic changes, suggestions).
	6.	Continuous Improvement
	â€¢	Schedule monthly website performance reviews to auto-optimize based on audit history (speed improvements, keyword refresh, schema upgrades, etc.).

Technical Preferences:
	â€¢	Frontend: whatever matches the current stack (ensure no unnecessary page reloads).
	â€¢	Backend: Node.js / Python preferred.
	â€¢	Database (if needed for logs/ranking history): lightweight (PostgreSQL, Firebase, etc.).
	â€¢	Hosting: Maintain existing (but ensure CDN and caching layers are in place).

Ultimate Goal:
The website should become a self-improving SEO machine, with minimal manual input needed â€” just review reports and approve recommended changes.

# Application Information Storage

This directory stores application form submissions as text files.

## File Format

Files are named using the pattern: `application_{timestamp}_{name}.txt`

Each file contains the application data in a readable text format with fields clearly labeled.

## Security Notice

This simple file-based storage system is for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, sensitive user data should be stored in a secure database with proper encryption and access controls.
